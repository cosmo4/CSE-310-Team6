# CSE 310 - Team Project Report

Canvas Team Number: 6

Team Member Names: Luke Warner, Avery Anderson, Gabe Hayes, Jehyeon Kweon, Corbin Andrus

## Part 1 - Initial Planning

This section should be filled out during the first Sprint and submitted by one member of the team.

### Section 1.1 - Initial Project Scope

During this semester, your team will work together to create an application to help students in college.  Your app can be written for the web, mobile device, desktop, or terminal.  The app must include some form of data storage in either a database or a file.  During Sprint 2 you will provide a more detailed scope of the project. 

1. Provide a high level description of the software you plan to create: 

    > We plan to create a note app that will allow users to take notes from their classes, and then use AI to summarize the results and prompt users to review their notes at a later time.

2. Describe the purpose of the Software:

    > The purpose of the software is to help student users take notes, utilize AI to summarize their notes, and review their notes at a later date.

3. Identify the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries you will most likely need to learn and use:

    > We will want to build a simple desktop app using the python language. The libraries involved in that would be tkinter and the ChatGPT libraries. We will also need to setup a GitHub repo. 

### Section 1.2 Communication

1. What tool will use for team assignments (e.g. Trello, MS Planner, Asana)? 

    > We will use a Trello board to create tasks and assignments.

2. What tool will use for team communication (e.g. MS Teams, Slack, Discord)? 

    > We will use our MS Teams channel to communicate.

3. Is every team members connected with the tools that you selected?

    > We are all added to the MS Teams channel, and we will create the GitHub repo and Trello board on Wednesday.

### Section 3.2 - Retrospection

1. Did all team members create a fork of the public GitHub repository to include in their own personal software portfolio?

Yes

2. Spend at least 10 minutes as a team have a retrospection meeting (also called a lessons learned).  Identify 3 things that went well and 3 things that did not go well.  Scope your observations to the team and not about specific individuals.  For the things that did not go well, identify how you can improve in future team projects.

Things that went well:

Enjoyed working together and growing as a team
The collaborative environment fostered team growth and enhanced overall project dynamics.

Great planning on features and distributing work
Effective planning and task distribution ensured that the project progressed smoothly and on schedule.

Successfully integrated all our ideas into the final product
The team's ability to integrate diverse ideas led to a cohesive and functional final product.

Things that did not go well and how to improve:

Commenting and organization throughout the duration of the project could be improved
Improvement: Implement a standardized commenting system and maintain consistent organization practices to reduce clutter and improve readability for future projects.

More comprehensive understanding of all the libraries and technologies used
Improvement: Allocate time for team members to gain a deeper understanding of the libraries and technologies before starting the project. Consider organizing knowledge-sharing sessions or workshops.

Visual changes just to make things more consistent and look nicer
Improvement: Establish a clear design and style guide early in the project. Regularly review and update the design to ensure consistency and visual appeal throughout the development process.
